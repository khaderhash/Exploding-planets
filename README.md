# Asteroid Dodging Game ðŸš€

## Project Description
A simple game using the Pygame library where the player controls a character dodging falling asteroids. The player can collect special power-up orbs that grant a temporary shield or weapon upgrade. The goal is to achieve the highest possible score as levels increase and difficulty rises.

## Installation
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Install Pygame via terminal/command prompt:
3. Download all project files (code, assets like images and sounds).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library
- Assets folder containing images and sounds

## How to Use
- Run the main file `main.py` using Python:
- Control the player using the left and right arrow keys.
- Press left mouse button to shoot bullets (when weapon upgrade is active).
- Avoid red asteroids.
- Collect yellow orbs to activate shield or weapon upgrade.

## Usage Example
When the game starts, the player character appears at the bottom of the screen, and asteroids fall from the top. Collecting a yellow shield orb activates a temporary shield icon and protects you from one collision. Collecting a weapon upgrade orb allows double shooting for a limited time.
